            <p>Power Red is similar to a whole blood donation, except a special <br>machine is used to allow you to
                safely
                donate two units of red blood <br>cells during one donation while returning your plasma and platelets to
                <br>
                you.

            <h1>The Benefits</h1>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Why should you do it?</strong> You may already know about the ongoing need for blood and the
                    importance of
                    your blood donations. Whole blood donations contain red blood cells, platelets, plasma and white
                    blood cells. Red blood cells are the most frequently used blood component and are needed by almost
                    every type of patient requiring transfusion. If you meet certain criteria, Power Red allows you to
                    safely donate two units of red cells during one appointment as an automated donation process. It is
                    as safe as whole blood donation
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How is it different?</strong> During your Power Red, blood is drawn from one arm through an
                    automated
                    process. The machine separates and collects two units of red cells and then safely returns the
                    remaining blood components, along with some saline, back to you through the same arm.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Save time and make your blood donation go further:</strong> If you are extremely busy,
                    committed to donating
                    blood and an eligible <strong>type O, A negative or B negative donor</strong>, Power Red may be
                    ideal for you. Each
                    procedure lets you give more of the product that is needed most by patients. Power Red (double red
                    cell donation) takes approximately 30 minutes longer than a whole blood donation and you can donate
                    approximately every four months.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Feel better: With all of your platelets and plasma returned to you along with some saline, you don’t
                    lose the liquid portion of your blood and may feel more hydrated after your donation.
                </li>
            </ul>
